Dated: July, 2014

This code was a part of my assignment for the Online Course of Creative Programming on Coursera. We were supposed to design a game on terms similar to that of the code given to us of Angry Droids (read Angry birds)r.
In my game,which is set up in outer space, the astronaut tries to destroy as many asteroids as it can. The user can do so by pulling the catapult with a desired intensity.

This game has been designed in the Processing Environment using Java and box2d.
